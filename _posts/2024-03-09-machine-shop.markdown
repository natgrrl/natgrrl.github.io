## OVERVIEW
I have 8 years of experience with using machine shop tools, including the mill, lathe, drill press, mitre saw, band saw, hand drills, soldering, belt sanders, dremels, angle grinders, and even some welding.  As the mechanical fabrication lead on my high school robotics team, I was also responsible for training mechanical sub-team members on using these tools safely.
