## OVERVIEW
For my Junior year in the Engineering strand at the Governor's School for Science & Technology we had to design a bridge in CAD. I designed our bridge in CAD, specifically OnShape. It was then laser cut from foam board, and we glued it together.  Below is a picture of the final bridge.

Contest results: It held 108.4 lbs!! As far as anyone knows it was the all time record for weight.  The 2nd place bridge, in this competition, held 40 something lbs.
