title: "Capstone Project"
date: 2025-03-01
description: To graduate, all Mechanical engineering students must undertake a capstone design project where they create a solution for some type of problem. My chosen project focuses on Distal Radius Fracture Reduction, and my team and  I are designing an accessible and inexpensive 3D-printed reduction device.

Currently, many medical students get their first hands-on experience manually setting a wrist fracture by performing the procedure on an injured patient under guidance from an experienced doctor. Although a few DRF reduction simulation devices are on the market, the more realistic models range from $800 to $2700. Additionally, some of the more popular devices are designed after a 6â€™2 male, which is not representative of the general population that experiences DRF. My capstone project involved an iterative and hands-on design process to design a more affordable and accessible DRF reduction simulator. The technical report below details the design process and the techniques we used to ensure its efficacy, including FEA, structural calculations, and tensile testing.

## Technical Report
While the report itself is quite detailed, a quick scroll through, glancing at all of the figures and images, will provide a great idea of the iterative design process and mechanical engineering calculations!

## Medical Simulators
My team and I are collaborating with Dr. Aaron Freilich at the UVA Orthopedic Center to design this device. He has been working closely with us and has shown us a plethora of other really interesting medical simulators.

## Basic Prototype

## Updated Design and CAD 
We are currently working on adding a worm gear mechanism in the base to allow the tendons(elastic bands) to be individually tightened, representing the varying muscle and soft tissue forces that different patients exert on the fragment. We are also adding a mounting mechanism to the base that enables medical students to wrap a splint around the bottom of the forearm and practice casting it.
