description: Since my second year I have been doing research with Professor Daniel Quinn (Ph.D.) in the UVA link lab. Our research hopes to externally monitor breathing patterns such that events like asthma attacks can be predicted and prevented before they occur # Add post description (optional)

## OVERVIEW

My work is a follow-up to the research that Ph.D. student [Lucy Fitzgerald](https://engineering.virginia.edu/news/2020/05/good-creating-accessible-medical-technology-all) was working on. Lucy was able to successfully implant a very small sensor into the airway of a rabbit and have it detect when an asthma attack was occurring. The first live testing of this kind of device!

[Professor Daniel Quinn](https://news.virginia.edu/content/engineers-physician-collaborating-detect-impending-asthma-attacks) and I want to make this type of tracking 1) able to predict an asthma attack BEFORE it happens and 2) non-invasive.

## Current Work

Currently, we are working on combining the 2 types of predictors for asthma attacks (biosignals & Environment) into a mechanical device. This is a two-part monitoring system that will involve sending realtime retrieved and collected data to the internet of things along with using an on-person audio device to pick up on signals of impending trouble breathing such as increased coughing or wheezing.
