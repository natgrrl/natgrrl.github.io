## OVERVIEW
For Junior year in the Engineering strand at the Governor's School for Science & Technology, my research project was a continuation of an award winning science fair project I did in 8th grade. The 8th grade project involved using arduino to create an environmental monitoring device that connected to the cloud using Internet of Things and could remotely check on the temperature and humidity of the tanks in my middle school's marine science lab.
