## OVERVIEW

When my professor told all of his students that we were going to have to do work with an actual client and that he was open to suggestions I got very excited. I was inspired by the Assistive Technology (AT) work that I did in high school and wanted to continue this in college. After researching several potential clients, I reached out to the company [Sportable](https://sportable.org/) based out of Richmond. Although I had never worked with them previously, they got back to me and were very interested in working together! 

After setting this project up for the next semester I acted as the point of contact for my team of 5 other students while we worked on an adaptive archery project. This project was aimed at allowing those who have limited hand dexterity to fire a bow without the use of their fingers or other finer motor skills.

Gaining User Insights:
We learned that finger dexterity is not the only user challenge â€“ lack of strength, an uncomfortable strap, & unsteady trigger are also issuesb we must also address in design
