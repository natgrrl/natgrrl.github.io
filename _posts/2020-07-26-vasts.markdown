## OVERVIEW

I completed the Virginia Aerospace Science and Technology Scholars (VASTS) 5-month online learning experience and was invited to participate in the VASTS Residential Academy at NASA Langley (online this year). I was the safety specialist for the mission transit team and had to ensure that the crew remained safe by working with radiation shielding, special equipment, and anything else necessary on the trip.  At the end of both of these programs we had to present our mission to NASA engineers and be prepared to answer all of their questions. Throughout my experience, I discovered that the most difficult aspect of a task is communicating with others, however, it is also the most crucial and helpful part.
