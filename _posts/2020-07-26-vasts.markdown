## OVERVIEW

I completed the Virginia Aerospace Science & Technology Scholar (VASTS) 5-month online program for Juniors & Seniors.  Based on my performance, I was selected to attend a seven-day residential summer academy at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., where students are immersed in NASA-related research through interaction with scientists, engineers and technologists.  Due to the pandemic, we were unable to attend the academy in person.  Instead, the academy was held virtually.
