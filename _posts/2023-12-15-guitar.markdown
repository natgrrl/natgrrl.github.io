## OVERVIEW

This electric guitar project took up most of the semester in the Advanced Mechatronics class, as it perfectly combined design, mechanical fabrication, programming, and electrical engineering. It was one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I have worked on!

The first step in this process was to decide on a design for a guitar. I had an idea of doing an ACDC thunderstruck guitar where the guitar's body was a cloud and the lighting shot up the neck. Our group even brainstormed about [ossibly making our own Lichtenberg wood burning to etch actual electricity into the neck using the tranformer from a microwave. We decided against this for a few reasons, the main two being that it was quite dangerous and the lightning pattern would not be controllable along the neck.

So instead I drew the lightning and guitar design on my Ipad and then exported it as a drawing file and then traced that drawing onto the neck surface in Solidworks

## CAM and CNC machining

After the main design was made we had to CNC both the body and the neck of the guitar. THe neck was the trickiest portion, as due to time constraints, we were not able to CAD the exact form of the neck(the only purchased part). So we got the main geometry equivalent and had to make sure it was centered and level on the machine. Below are some pictures of the machining process.
