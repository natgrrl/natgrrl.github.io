## OVERVIEW

I participate in Virginia Motorsports where we build a Formula SAE car and get to race it against other teams. I participate in the suspension, drivetrain, chassy work, and a little CNCing. My first year I got the chance to travel to the Michigan International speedway, help present an award-winning presentation, and compete with our car!
