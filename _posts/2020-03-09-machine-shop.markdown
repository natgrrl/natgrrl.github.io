## OVERVIEW
I have 4 years of experienced with using machine shop tools, including mill, lathe, drill press, mitre saw, band saw, hand drills, soldering, belt sanders, dremels, angle grinders, etc.  As the mechanical fabrication lead on my team, I am also responsible for training mechanical sub-team members on using these tools safely.
