## OVERVIEW

When my professor told all of his students that we were going to have to do work with an actual client and that he was open to suggestions I got very excited. I was inspired by the Assistive Technology (AT) work that I did in high school and wanted to continue this in college. After researching several potential clients, I reached out to the company [Sportable](https://sportable.org/) which is based out of Richmond and focuses on making sports accessible for those with disabilities. Although I had never worked with them previously, they got back to me and were very interested in working together! 

After setting this project up for the next semester I acted as the point of contact for my team of 5 other students while we worked on an adaptive archery project. This project was aimed at allowing those who have limited hand dexterity to fire a bow without the use of their fingers or other finer motor skills.

## How did We Explore?

Gaining User Insights:

We learned that finger dexterity is not the only user challenge – lack of strength, an uncomfortable strap, & unsteady trigger are also issues we must also address in design.

Gaining Insights from Personal Experience:
We got to test out the equipment (we went to Rockwood Nature Center in Richmond on 2/24) and experienced the difficulties ourselves. The current technique involved using a finger trigger, but backward & on the face. We noticed that it was difficult to move your head backward while also drawing the string backward. This gave us an idea of what might help - a release motion going in the opposite direction, in other words, the release triggering with a head moving forward instead of backward. This motion would make the bow release feel more natural AND comfortable. Going there ourselves and testing out the way that the trigger was currently used by the athletes allowed us to draw our own conclusions and broaden our brainstorming without relying solely on the client. 

The next thing we did was brainstorm our FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Be usable without finger dexterity - Finger dexterity is a major challenge for our target user
- Be safe - Doesn’t injure the user
- Be consistent - Allows for the development of a learnable skill
- Be comfortable
- Be secure
- Be durable
- Be stable - Reduces variability while aiming
- Be lightweight - Reduces exhaustion during use
- Be usable by different people
- Different hand sizes, body types, disabilities, etc.
- Modifiable/adjustable 
- Be widely accessible & obtainable
- Be financially affordable
- Be able to be used on different bows
- Be intuitive
- Be visually unintimidating
- Stay open until closed manually

These allowed us to have a focused, open-ended brainstorming session:
