## OVERVIEW

I have created a number of designs using Computer Aided Design(CAD).  While I have tinkered with PTC Creo and done a tiny bit of Solidworks, most of my CAD designs has been created using OnShape, a free, web-based, easily accessible CAD software.

## MY DESK BUILD

I needed a desk in my room, so I searched the internet for various pictures of desks that I liked.  This one also had instructions to help with the build.  Then, I create the desk in CAD, using OnShape.  During the build I did swap the side that the shelves were on, so that my chair would not have my bed behind it limiting my movement. Below are pictures of the CAD drawing, the finished desk, and some pictures during the build.

## ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY DESIGNS

A VCU Occupational Therapy PHD student was spending robotics build season with our team to learn about designing &  fabricating Adaptive Technology devices to support her patients.  As our teams Assistive Technology Coordinator (ATC), I helped design a number mechanisms in CAD to assist people with disabilities.

We modified ride-on car for children with diabilities.  I designed the case for the joystick that we added to the car.

I also designed a mechanisom to mount on a wheelchair to hold a NERF Gun that our team modified for a patient to enjoy.

## MY JUNIOR BRIDGE BUILD:
For my Junior year in the Engineering strand at the Governorâ€™s School for Science & Technology we had to design a bridge in CAD. I designed our bridge in CAD, specifically OnShape. It was then laser cut from foam board, and we glued it together. It held 108.4 lbs!! As far as anyone knows it was the all time record for weight. The 2nd place bridge, in this competition, held 40 something lbs.

## MY ALLEN WRENCH HOLDER FOR MY TOOL BELT
 
I found I needed something to organize my allen wrenches in my tool belt and I wanted to learn a little Solidworks, so I design this little device:
