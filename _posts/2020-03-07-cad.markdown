## OVERVIEW

I have created a number of designs using Computer Aided Design(CAD).

## MY DESK BUILD

I needed as desk in my room, so I searched the internet for various pictures of desks.  Then I create the desk in CAD using OnShape.

## MY JUNIOR BRIDGE BUILD:
For my Junior year in the Engineering strand at the Governorâ€™s School for Science & Technology we had to design a bridge in CAD. I designed our bridge in CAD, specifically OnShape. It was then laser cut from foam board, and we glued it together. It held 108.4 lbs!! As far as anyone knows it was the all time record for weight. The 2nd place bridge, in this competition, held 40 something lbs.

A VCU Occupational Therapy PHD student was spending robotics build season with our team to learn about designing &  fabricating Adaptive Technology devices to support her patients.  I helped design a mechanism in CAD for use on a wheelchair to hold a NERF Gun that has been modified for a patient to enjoy.
