## OVERVIEW
As my robotics team begins a new school year, during a pandemic, myself and other team leaders have been thinking about what kind of STEM engineering we can do, within the restrictions placed on us by the pandemic weâ€™re all living through. 

We decided to create the Tele Operated Robotics Competition using FPV Drones -- which can be built by students at home and at the Peninsula STEM Gym, using the tools and techniques that are available to us.
