## OVERVIEW

Since I was given the opportunity to choose exactly what kind of final project I wanted to do for Mechanics Lab I knew that I wanted to do something applicable to my life. As one of my hobbies is rock climbing, and I am often in a situation where I have to build my own anchor outdoors, I decided I wanted to study the maximum tensile strength that different climbing anchors provide.
